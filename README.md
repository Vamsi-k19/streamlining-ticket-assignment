Streamlining Ticket Assignment for Efficient Operations

Team ID: 160664

This repository contains the documentation, configuration blueprints, and code snippets related to the implementation of an automated ticket routing solution within ServiceNow for ABC Corporation.

üöÄ Project Overview

The objective of this project was to transition ABC Corporation's support operations from manual ticket triage to an intelligent, automated assignment system. By leveraging ServiceNow's Flow Designer, the solution instantly routes incoming Operations Tickets to the correct support group (e.g., Certificate or Platform) based on ticket criteria, significantly reducing resolution times and improving overall team efficiency.

üéØ Goals

Automation: Develop an automated, criteria-based ticket distribution mechanism in ServiceNow.

Efficiency: Associate tickets with the correct support groups immediately upon creation to minimize resolution delays.

Security: Implement role-based ACLs to govern who can modify the core assignment logic.

Optimization: Optimize resource utilization within the support department.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack & Skills

This solution is built entirely within the ServiceNow platform, utilizing the following core components and skills:

Component

Purpose

ServiceNow

Platform hosting the solution.

Flow Designer

Used to build the core decision-making and assignment automation logic.

ACLs (Access Control Lists)

Ensures security and governance over the assignment configuration data.

User and Group Management

Used to define support teams (Certificate Group, Platform Group) and access roles.

Custom Tables

Used for centralized, low-code assignment mapping configuration.

üì¶ Key Implementation Components

1. Data Structure and Roles

Component

Detail

Custom Table

u_operations_related.

Assignment Groups

Certificate Group and Platform Group.

Custom Roles

Certification_role, Platform_role, and a 'Support Manager' role for ACL governance.

2. Security and Governance (ACLs)

Objective: Restrict who can modify the u_operations_related¬†table, preventing unauthorized changes to routing rules.

Implementation: A record-level write ACL is applied to the u_operatoins_related table, granting access only to the 'Support Manager' role and System Administrators.

3. Automation Logic (Flow Designer)

Trigger: The Flow is triggered upon creation or update of an Operations Ticket record.

Logic:

Look Up Records: The flow performs a lookup against the u_operations_related¬†table, using the ticket's Category or Issue Type as the key criteria.

Assignment: An Update Record action is executed to set the ticket's Assignment Group field to the group retrieved from the lookup result.
